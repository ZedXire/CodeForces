# CodeForces
This repository contains all of my successfull submisssions on codeforces. Programs may be written in C++ or Python, most probably C++.

Also, I use A2oJ.com for practicing CodeForces questions as per my rating, I have added it here as well.

I don't guarntee efficieny of any solutions presented int this repo, they are just my approach to solve it. Better solutions may or may not exist for the given problems.

NOTE : I have simply made repo of storage folder of my device, So an additional object file will be available for every other program that I made. Also, I used to provide input and output through files, that's why you may find some addtional txt files in most of the folders.

Thanks for visiting the repo.

Hit a star if you like it.

Have a nice day.
