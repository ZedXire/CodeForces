# CodeForces
This repository contains all of my successfull submisssions on codeforces. Programs may be written in C++, Python, JAVA. I would strongly prefer C++, but would use other language time to time for practise purpose.

Also, I have added my work from A2OJ.com to solve Codeforces questions.

I don't take guarntee for any solutions presented above, they are just my approach to solve it. Better solutions may or may not exist for the given problems.

Thanks for visiting the repo.
Have a nice day.
